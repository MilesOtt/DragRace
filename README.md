# DragRace

My goal is to teach myself new skills while playing around with RuPaul's Drag Race data

## About RPDR

RuPaul's Drag Race is a reality show competition in which drag queens must use their charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent to rise above the rest in hopes of being crowned the winner each season. Each episode is usually composed of a mini-challenge (often involving quick drag), a maxi-challenge (including longer form acting, singing, dancing, sewing, comedy, etc challenges), and a themed runway.  The judges then deliberate, RuPaul decides who the tops and bottoms are, a lypsynch is performed, and one or more of the queens is sent home, while one or more of the queens wins.  Since season 2 when Shangela was the first queen to be eliminated, each eliminated queen has written a departing message on a mirror in the werkroom in lipstick.

## Files
* __RPDR_Mirror_Messages.csv__ includes variables `text` (the lipstick mirror messages written by an eliminated drag queen on the mirror before she departs), `drag_queen` (the name of the eliminated drag queen), and `season` (2-12 and All Stars 2-4). 
  - Data from Seasons 2-9 and All Stars 2 was taken from https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/6olcho/the_mirror_messages_of_every_queen/
  - The rest of the data was painstakingly collected by Miles Ott and Benjamin Capistrant by going through each episode and transcribing the messages
